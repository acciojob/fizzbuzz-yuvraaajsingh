# FizzBuzz

## Instructions

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 20 using `alert`.

- For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number.
- For multiples of five print "Buzz" instead of the number.
- For multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

## Expected Output:

- The output should be a string that contains the numbers from 1 to 100 with "Fizz", "Buzz", and "FizzBuzz" substituted for multiples of three, five, and both, respectively.
- Each number/string should be separated by a newline character ("\n").

## Acceptance Criteria:

- Lines that represent multiples of three should contain the string "Fizz".
- Lines that represent multiples of five should contain the string "Buzz".
- Lines that represent multiples of both three and five should contain the string "FizzBuzz".
- Lines that represent numbers that are not multiples of three or five should contain the number itself as a string.
- The output should be in the correct order, with each line corresponding to the correct number.
